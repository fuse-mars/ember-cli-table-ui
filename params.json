{"name":"Ember-cli Table","tagline":"Place for describing my design decisions on creating a table component in ember","body":"### Inspiration\r\nEmber-table addon from Addepar (https://github.com/Addepar/ember-table), provides a good solution for Ember-js developers who want to display data in a table.\r\nHowever, it does not cover a use case of data that needs frequent updates\r\ni.e. Changes made to a cell value has to be persisted to the backend.\r\n\r\nIn this case:\r\n* Ember-data is being used to communicate with the backend.\r\n* A path to read the cell value is different from a path used to save new/updated value.\r\n* \r\n\r\n### Philosophy\r\n* A table is An HTML structure for creating rows and columns on a Web page. This means that you can use table for multiple reasons, but in our case, a **table** solve a soul purpose of efficiently presenting large number of data.\r\n* Data is Factual information, especially information organized for analysis or used to reason or make decisions, when this data is presented using a table we call it tabular data.\r\n* Tabular data is any data that can be displayed in an excel sheet or stored in a database.\r\n\r\n### Design\r\n* A table is composed of **rows** and **columns**.\r\n* Each row is identified by a number (1, 2, 3 ... )\r\n* Each column is identified by a name ('name', 'email' ...)\r\n* Intersection between a row and a column is a **cell**.\r\n* Cells are owner of the displayed **piece of data** (value of a cell, which is visual to the user).\r\n* A piece of data, in Ember-js terms, is represented as an **attribute** of an Ember-Data **Model object**.\r\n* The model-object above in is owned by the row.\r\n* Each column holds information on how to manipulate pieces of data from the model-object.\r\n* By **manipulate** I mean getting and updating value of a cell.\r\n\r\n### Resource\r\n* https://blog.udemy.com/html5-tables\r\n* http://webdesign.about.com/od/tables/a/aa122605.htm\r\n* http://www.echoecho.com/htmltables.htm\r\n* http://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/44496/html-table\r\n","google":"UA-68265226-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
